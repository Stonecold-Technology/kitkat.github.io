KitKat - Random page



This is a random webpage with no specific purpose other than to demonstrate some technique(s) of web development. Specifically, Structure. 

The image gallery is

•	Responsive - the number of columns adjust according to screen size

And there is a nice zoom in effect as the mouse hovers. The webpage also uses font files for 'Comfotaa' style. It was built using HTML and CSS only, it shows an image gallery, header, discrete footer, and a “hero image” that is common on many sites.
